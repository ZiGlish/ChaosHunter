# ChaosHunter
## A Random Hunt loadout generator

Created with nodejs 12.18.2
node modules:
1. csv-parser: "^2.3.3"

*Attempting* to use the air-bnb style guide.

This project is one part community service, one part learning excersize, and three parts experiment.
I mention this just as a warning that sometime I take the code base in an *unconventional* direction, just to see what I learn along the way.
