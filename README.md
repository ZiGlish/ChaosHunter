### A Random Hunt loadout generator

*README Last Updated: **Sept. 05, 2020***

Created with nodejs 12.18.2
node modules:
1. csv-parser: "^2.3.3"

*Attempting* to use the air-bnb style guide.

This project is one part community service, one part learning excersize, and three parts experiment.
I mention this just as a warning that sometime I take the code base in an *unconventional* direction, just to see what I learn along the way.

### **Rough** Roadmap:
1. **v1.2.0**
	1. Refactor Client-side javascript to use JQuery
	1. Refactor HTML generation (just to see how it goes)
	1. Add testing suite
1. **v1.3.0**
	1. Rework the roll logic to improve randomness
		* current version is influenced too heavily by weapon size
		* ready the code for selection, budget, and querystring features.
	1. Prototype Item Selection
1. **v1.4.0**
	1. Build Budgets (Maximum cost of build)
	1. Lock Scrolling to bottom of page when opening credits
1. **v1.5.0**
	1. Save and Load builds by Query String
1. **v1.6.0**
	1. Add Cookie to save item & option selections
		* Add the Legal footnote about cookies.
